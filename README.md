Email Dev: # Tree-Core-Email-

General: 

-Scale 0.5 - From PSD. 600px max-width, in case media queries don't work the mail should be always in the range of 600px-640px for screen compatibility.

-To show only the preview text ”Lightweight, breathable eucalyptus” after the subject line. you have always to make some space(&nbsp;) . This is just to prevent any other email content from being displayed.

-According to the task,"CSS classes in the email need to be clearly declared and be reusable for future emails". 
CSS should be always inline for more Email providers support. CSS has been declared twice inline and as classes only for the record and reuse only.

Dark-Mode criteria:

-White Border on CTA

-Main Div background changed the color #F1F1F1(it could be another color exept #FFFFFF ) to keep the body format. (Darkmode.png) 

-I think Gif image with white background is not a good option for this design. You can always use gif with the same background color or try transparent gif or APNGs depending the case. you can also use a full image with some padding with other color like the borders of the hero image.
